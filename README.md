# Hangman-V2
This repo is a hangman game that was converted from Snap! by Berkeley. In 2018 when I first started programming, I created a hangman game using drag-and-drop coding on Snap! This is my attempt at recreating the said game in Javascript using the knowledge I accumulated thus far. Below is the link to the original game I created.
